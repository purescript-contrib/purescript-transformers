## Module Control.Monad.Maybe.Trans

This module defines the `MaybeT` monad transformer.

#### `MaybeT`

``` purescript
newtype MaybeT m a
  = MaybeT (m (Maybe a))
```

The `MaybeT` monad transformer.

This monad transformer extends the base monad, supporting failure and alternation via
the `MonadPlus` type class.

instance monadRWSMaybeT :: (MonadRWS r w s m) => MonadRWS r w s (MaybeT m)
```

#### `runMaybeT`

``` purescript
runMaybeT :: forall m a. MaybeT m a -> m (Maybe a)
```

Run a computation in the `MaybeT` monad.

#### `mapMaybeT`

``` purescript
mapMaybeT :: forall m1 m2 a b. (m1 (Maybe a) -> m2 (Maybe b)) -> MaybeT m1 a -> MaybeT m2 b
```

Change the result type of a `MaybeT` monad action.
