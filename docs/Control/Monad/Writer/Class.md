## Module Control.Monad.Writer.Class

This module defines the `MonadWriter` type class and its instances.

#### `MonadWriter`

``` purescript
class (Monad m) <= MonadWriter w m where
  writer :: forall a. Tuple a w -> m a
  listen :: forall a. m a -> m (Tuple a w)
  pass :: forall a. m (Tuple a (w -> w)) -> m a
```

The `MonadWriter w` type class represents those monads which support a monoidal accumulator
of type `w`.

- `writer` appends a value to the accumulator.
- `listen` modifies the result to include the changes to the accumulator.
- `pass` applies the returned function to the accumulator.

An implementation is provided for `WriterT`, and for other monad transformers
defined in this library.

Laws:

- `writer a mempty = pure a`
- `do { tell x ; tell y } = tell (x <> y)`
- `listen (pure a) = pure (Tuple a mempty)`
- `listen (writer a x) = tell x $> Tuple a x`


#### `tell`

``` purescript
tell :: forall w m a. (Monoid w, MonadWriter w m) => w -> m Unit
```

Append a value to the accumulator.

#### `listens`

``` purescript
listens :: forall w m a b. (Monoid w, MonadWriter w m) => (w -> b) -> m a -> m (Tuple a b)
```

Read a value which depends on the modifications made to the accumulator during an action.

#### `censor`

``` purescript
censor :: forall w m a. (Monoid w, MonadWriter w m) => (w -> w) -> m a -> m a
```

Modify the final accumulator value by applying a function.
